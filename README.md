# Dungeons 💕with🐉 Dragons

This mock dating app has the user swipe through potential matches of either dungeons or dragons, either skipping them or adding them to their matches. From the match page, the user can either remove the match or chat with the match - standard dating app functionality. 

You can jump right into the app [here](https://dungeonswithdragons.onrender.com). Note that swiping only works on mobile devices. For more information, check out this project's [Medium article](https://medium.com/@adamtwright7/dungeons-with-dragons-299756fb3bd4).
